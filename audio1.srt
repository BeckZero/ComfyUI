1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Yosano is a quiet girl who moves to Tokyo to live with her uncle.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,860
The moment she gets there, she sees a shooting star and faints from the shock.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,280
Right before she hits the ground, a mysterious hand catches her.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,320
Turns out, that hand belongs to a pretty unusual guy.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,200
At first, he doesn't seem like a big deal.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,840
Until the next day, when Yosano spots him at school and realizes he's Shishio,

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,040
her teacher, underneath his quirky hat, he's actually super handsome.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,920
And he's not just there to teach her history.

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,840
He's about to teach her what it means to fall in love.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,320
But Shishio isn't the only one catching her attention.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,480
There's also Mamora, a good-looking classmate who lets her borrow his notes,

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,500
but gets all flustered and annoyed whenever she touches him.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,860
And she has no clue why.

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,480
One day, overwhelmed, Yosano escapes to the rooftop.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,240
There, Shishio gets so close that she swears she can see stars reflected in his eyes.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,820
He tells her she should try making some friends, so Yosano decides to get closer to Mamora.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,520
But he brushes her off, until she accidentally touches him and he turns bright red.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,820
Turns out, he's just super shy around girls.

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,900
After Yosano discovers his little secret, Mamora starts opening up to her.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,500
And the two of them end up becoming friends.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,080
Yosano is thrilled.

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,840
But their new friendship catches everyone off guard.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,860
Especially Yuyuka, who secretly has feelings for Mamora and is totally jealous of how close they've gotten.

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,280
So, during a school trip, Yuyuka tricks Yosano into going to a random cabin deep in the woods.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,780
As you'd expect, Yosano gets lost.

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,020
But Mamora shows up, willing to do whatever it takes to find her.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,260
It's like Yosano's perfume is guiding him.

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,860
Or maybe it's just his heart leading the way.

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,800
Mamora opens up, telling Yosano that he's shy because his mom abandoned him when he was a kid.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,060
It eats him up inside, especially since he doesn't want to be that way around her.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:25,120
Honestly, when she falls asleep on his shoulder, all he wants is to kiss her like there's no tomorrow.

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,140
Just when he's about to go for it, Shishio shows up, worried.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,780
Yosano's smile lights up like never before, leaving Mamora crushed.

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:43,540
Later that night, Yosano wakes up, and Shishio tries to cheer her up by filling the room with fireflies, hoping she'll have sweet dreams.

35
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,120
Then, he checks her temperature.

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:55,320
Which, let's be real, wouldn't be surprising if she had a fever, considering how flustered she gets every time he gets this close.

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,880
The next day, Yosano calls Yuyuka out for tricking her during the trip.

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:09,180
But when Mamora asks what's going on, Yosano just plays it off because deep down, she doesn't want to lose Yuyuka as a friend.

39
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,140
In the end, Yuyuka apologizes and even helps Yosano with clothes and makeup.

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,900
So when Shishio sees her hiding behind a curtain, he literally can't help but feel his heart skip a beat.

41
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,260
The teacher, who's always been so chill, now looks at her, all serious and confused.

42
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:35,060
Because the Yosano standing in front of him isn't the same girl he knew, and that look in her eyes stirs something inside him.

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,520
After that, they hang out and have fun.

44
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,380
At one point, Shishio holds her hand to keep her from falling, though honestly, he wishes he never had to let go.

45
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:54,640
They tell each other how much they love spending time together, and even after letting go of each other's hands, the connection between them is still there.

46
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,160
Yosano even dreams about Shishio turning around to look at her.

47
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,540
And he actually does!

48
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,260
Like they can really read each other's minds.

49
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,020
In that moment, Yosano feels like nothing could make her happier.

50
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,020
But out of nowhere, Mamura surprises her with a kiss.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:23,300
She's left stunned, totally confused by how this guy, who always seems so distant, is suddenly showing her how deeply he loves her.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:33,340
Mamura, completely embarrassed, runs off, leaving Yosano feeling terrible, because she knows that if Yuyuka finds out, she'll be furious.

53
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,140
So Yosano decides to keep it to herself.

54
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,420
In fact, Yuyuka even encourages her to confess her feelings to Shishio by text.

55
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,260
But Shishio replies, saying he's really busy right now.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,540
Feeling down, Yosano is about to head home, when Mamura shows up and takes her to this magical, fairy-tale-like spot.

57
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,500
There, she reveals it's actually her birthday, without hesitating.
