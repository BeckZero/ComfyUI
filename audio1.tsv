0	4640	Yosano is a quiet girl who moves to Tokyo to live with her uncle.
5140	10860	The moment she gets there, she sees a shooting star and faints from the shock.
11020	15280	Right before she hits the ground, a mysterious hand catches her.
15400	19320	Turns out, that hand belongs to a pretty unusual guy.
19820	22200	At first, he doesn't seem like a big deal.
22600	28840	Until the next day, when Yosano spots him at school and realizes he's Shishio,
28840	34040	her teacher, underneath his quirky hat, he's actually super handsome.
34700	36920	And he's not just there to teach her history.
37420	40840	He's about to teach her what it means to fall in love.
41560	44320	But Shishio isn't the only one catching her attention.
44920	49480	There's also Mamora, a good-looking classmate who lets her borrow his notes,
49640	53500	but gets all flustered and annoyed whenever she touches him.
53660	55860	And she has no clue why.
55860	59480	One day, overwhelmed, Yosano escapes to the rooftop.
60240	66240	There, Shishio gets so close that she swears she can see stars reflected in his eyes.
66420	71820	He tells her she should try making some friends, so Yosano decides to get closer to Mamora.
72300	79520	But he brushes her off, until she accidentally touches him and he turns bright red.
80260	83820	Turns out, he's just super shy around girls.
83820	89900	After Yosano discovers his little secret, Mamora starts opening up to her.
90240	93500	And the two of them end up becoming friends.
93700	95080	Yosano is thrilled.
95580	98840	But their new friendship catches everyone off guard.
99180	105860	Especially Yuyuka, who secretly has feelings for Mamora and is totally jealous of how close they've gotten.
105860	112280	So, during a school trip, Yuyuka tricks Yosano into going to a random cabin deep in the woods.
112540	114780	As you'd expect, Yosano gets lost.
115220	119020	But Mamora shows up, willing to do whatever it takes to find her.
119380	122260	It's like Yosano's perfume is guiding him.
122620	124860	Or maybe it's just his heart leading the way.
125100	130800	Mamora opens up, telling Yosano that he's shy because his mom abandoned him when he was a kid.
130800	137060	It eats him up inside, especially since he doesn't want to be that way around her.
137880	145120	Honestly, when she falls asleep on his shoulder, all he wants is to kiss her like there's no tomorrow.
145340	149140	Just when he's about to go for it, Shishio shows up, worried.
149720	154780	Yosano's smile lights up like never before, leaving Mamora crushed.
154780	163540	Later that night, Yosano wakes up, and Shishio tries to cheer her up by filling the room with fireflies, hoping she'll have sweet dreams.
164180	166120	Then, he checks her temperature.
166700	175320	Which, let's be real, wouldn't be surprising if she had a fever, considering how flustered she gets every time he gets this close.
175320	179880	The next day, Yosano calls Yuyuka out for tricking her during the trip.
180400	189180	But when Mamora asks what's going on, Yosano just plays it off because deep down, she doesn't want to lose Yuyuka as a friend.
189420	195140	In the end, Yuyuka apologizes and even helps Yosano with clothes and makeup.
195260	201900	So when Shishio sees her hiding behind a curtain, he literally can't help but feel his heart skip a beat.
201900	207260	The teacher, who's always been so chill, now looks at her, all serious and confused.
207460	215060	Because the Yosano standing in front of him isn't the same girl he knew, and that look in her eyes stirs something inside him.
215160	217520	After that, they hang out and have fun.
217900	225380	At one point, Shishio holds her hand to keep her from falling, though honestly, he wishes he never had to let go.
225380	234640	They tell each other how much they love spending time together, and even after letting go of each other's hands, the connection between them is still there.
235460	239160	Yosano even dreams about Shishio turning around to look at her.
239680	241540	And he actually does!
241740	244260	Like they can really read each other's minds.
244860	249020	In that moment, Yosano feels like nothing could make her happier.
249020	253020	But out of nowhere, Mamura surprises her with a kiss.
253480	263300	She's left stunned, totally confused by how this guy, who always seems so distant, is suddenly showing her how deeply he loves her.
263480	273340	Mamura, completely embarrassed, runs off, leaving Yosano feeling terrible, because she knows that if Yuyuka finds out, she'll be furious.
273740	276140	So Yosano decides to keep it to herself.
276140	282420	In fact, Yuyuka even encourages her to confess her feelings to Shishio by text.
282700	286260	But Shishio replies, saying he's really busy right now.
286320	294540	Feeling down, Yosano is about to head home, when Mamura shows up and takes her to this magical, fairy-tale-like spot.
294880	299500	There, she reveals it's actually her birthday, without hesitating.
