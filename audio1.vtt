00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Yosano is a quiet girl who moves to Tokyo to live with her uncle.

00:05.140 --> 00:10.860
The moment she gets there, she sees a shooting star and faints from the shock.

00:11.020 --> 00:15.280
Right before she hits the ground, a mysterious hand catches her.

00:15.400 --> 00:19.320
Turns out, that hand belongs to a pretty unusual guy.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.200
At first, he doesn't seem like a big deal.

00:22.600 --> 00:28.840
Until the next day, when Yosano spots him at school and realizes he's Shishio,

00:28.840 --> 00:34.040
her teacher, underneath his quirky hat, he's actually super handsome.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.920
And he's not just there to teach her history.

00:37.420 --> 00:40.840
He's about to teach her what it means to fall in love.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.320
But Shishio isn't the only one catching her attention.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.480
There's also Mamora, a good-looking classmate who lets her borrow his notes,

00:49.640 --> 00:53.500
but gets all flustered and annoyed whenever she touches him.

00:53.660 --> 00:55.860
And she has no clue why.

00:55.860 --> 00:59.480
One day, overwhelmed, Yosano escapes to the rooftop.

01:00.240 --> 01:06.240
There, Shishio gets so close that she swears she can see stars reflected in his eyes.

01:06.420 --> 01:11.820
He tells her she should try making some friends, so Yosano decides to get closer to Mamora.

01:12.300 --> 01:19.520
But he brushes her off, until she accidentally touches him and he turns bright red.

01:20.260 --> 01:23.820
Turns out, he's just super shy around girls.

01:23.820 --> 01:29.900
After Yosano discovers his little secret, Mamora starts opening up to her.

01:30.240 --> 01:33.500
And the two of them end up becoming friends.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.080
Yosano is thrilled.

01:35.580 --> 01:38.840
But their new friendship catches everyone off guard.

01:39.180 --> 01:45.860
Especially Yuyuka, who secretly has feelings for Mamora and is totally jealous of how close they've gotten.

01:45.860 --> 01:52.280
So, during a school trip, Yuyuka tricks Yosano into going to a random cabin deep in the woods.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.780
As you'd expect, Yosano gets lost.

01:55.220 --> 01:59.020
But Mamora shows up, willing to do whatever it takes to find her.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.260
It's like Yosano's perfume is guiding him.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.860
Or maybe it's just his heart leading the way.

02:05.100 --> 02:10.800
Mamora opens up, telling Yosano that he's shy because his mom abandoned him when he was a kid.

02:10.800 --> 02:17.060
It eats him up inside, especially since he doesn't want to be that way around her.

02:17.880 --> 02:25.120
Honestly, when she falls asleep on his shoulder, all he wants is to kiss her like there's no tomorrow.

02:25.340 --> 02:29.140
Just when he's about to go for it, Shishio shows up, worried.

02:29.720 --> 02:34.780
Yosano's smile lights up like never before, leaving Mamora crushed.

02:34.780 --> 02:43.540
Later that night, Yosano wakes up, and Shishio tries to cheer her up by filling the room with fireflies, hoping she'll have sweet dreams.

02:44.180 --> 02:46.120
Then, he checks her temperature.

02:46.700 --> 02:55.320
Which, let's be real, wouldn't be surprising if she had a fever, considering how flustered she gets every time he gets this close.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.880
The next day, Yosano calls Yuyuka out for tricking her during the trip.

03:00.400 --> 03:09.180
But when Mamora asks what's going on, Yosano just plays it off because deep down, she doesn't want to lose Yuyuka as a friend.

03:09.420 --> 03:15.140
In the end, Yuyuka apologizes and even helps Yosano with clothes and makeup.

03:15.260 --> 03:21.900
So when Shishio sees her hiding behind a curtain, he literally can't help but feel his heart skip a beat.

03:21.900 --> 03:27.260
The teacher, who's always been so chill, now looks at her, all serious and confused.

03:27.460 --> 03:35.060
Because the Yosano standing in front of him isn't the same girl he knew, and that look in her eyes stirs something inside him.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.520
After that, they hang out and have fun.

03:37.900 --> 03:45.380
At one point, Shishio holds her hand to keep her from falling, though honestly, he wishes he never had to let go.

03:45.380 --> 03:54.640
They tell each other how much they love spending time together, and even after letting go of each other's hands, the connection between them is still there.

03:55.460 --> 03:59.160
Yosano even dreams about Shishio turning around to look at her.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.540
And he actually does!

04:01.740 --> 04:04.260
Like they can really read each other's minds.

04:04.860 --> 04:09.020
In that moment, Yosano feels like nothing could make her happier.

04:09.020 --> 04:13.020
But out of nowhere, Mamura surprises her with a kiss.

04:13.480 --> 04:23.300
She's left stunned, totally confused by how this guy, who always seems so distant, is suddenly showing her how deeply he loves her.

04:23.480 --> 04:33.340
Mamura, completely embarrassed, runs off, leaving Yosano feeling terrible, because she knows that if Yuyuka finds out, she'll be furious.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.140
So Yosano decides to keep it to herself.

04:36.140 --> 04:42.420
In fact, Yuyuka even encourages her to confess her feelings to Shishio by text.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.260
But Shishio replies, saying he's really busy right now.

04:46.320 --> 04:54.540
Feeling down, Yosano is about to head home, when Mamura shows up and takes her to this magical, fairy-tale-like spot.

04:54.880 --> 04:59.500
There, she reveals it's actually her birthday, without hesitating.
